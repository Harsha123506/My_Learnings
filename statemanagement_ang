rxJx is a statement system follows redux pattern used by react. Where we have single state of truth. It has 5 principles.
store :: angular stores the whole state of the application in the form of one big Object. and use it to have a utilisation of other components to achieve single state of truth.
Actions :: its an object that have events occured which will change the state.
Reducers :: It takes store and actions and return the immutable new state.
Selectors :: It allows us to take a single slice of an Object
side Effects :: this will handles the side effects like api calls , navogations, database connections that should happen as part of the state change.

Ngrx Libraries :: ngrxstore , ngrxeffects, Router, ngrxEntity, ngrxdata

ngrxstore :: Used to manage in memory state with action and reducer
ngrxeffect :: handle sideeffects.
routerstore :: store router data.
ngrxentity :: stores state as entity to apply crud operations.
ngrxdata :: provides reducers and actions behind the scene.

store :: only one store exists , immutable , only changeable via reducers and sideeffects, epxposes as Observable, allowing to subscibe rand react to change
actions :: have uniquetype to idetify events. can carry payload, they should clearly describe its event.
reducers :: for same input they always produce same output, wont mutate state instead return new state.
