1. What is SQL?
Answer:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It supports querying, inserting, updating, deleting, and managing data.

2. What are the different types of SQL statements?
Answer:

DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP

DML (Data Manipulation Language): SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE

TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

3. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
Answer:

WHERE filters rows before grouping.

HAVING filters groups after aggregation.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
4. What is a Primary Key?
Answer:
A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a table. It:

Cannot be NULL

Must be unique

5. What is a Foreign Key?
Answer:
A Foreign Key is a field in one table that refers to the Primary Key in another table. It enforces referential integrity.

🟡 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Joins, Subqueries, Functions)
6. What are the types of joins in SQL?
Answer:

INNER JOIN: Matches records in both tables

LEFT JOIN: All records from left table + matched ones from right

RIGHT JOIN: All records from right table + matched ones from left

FULL OUTER JOIN: All records from both tables

SELF JOIN: Joining a table to itself

CROSS JOIN: Cartesian product

7. What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?
Operation	Description	Can Rollback?	Removes Table Structure?
DELETE	Removes rows with WHERE	✅ Yes	❌ No
TRUNCATE	Removes all rows, faster	❌ No	❌ No
DROP	Deletes table completely	❌ No	✅ Yes

8. What is a subquery?
Answer:
A subquery is a query inside another query. It can be used in SELECT, FROM, or WHERE.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
9. What are Aggregate Functions?
Answer:

COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()
Used to perform calculations on data.

10. What is the difference between RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and ROW_NUMBER()?
Answer:
Used in window functions:

Function	Gaps in ranking?	Duplicates?
ROW_NUMBER()	No	No
RANK()	Yes	Yes
DENSE_RANK()	No	Yes

🔵 ADVANCED LEVEL (Indexes, Optimization, Transactions)
11. What are indexes in SQL?
Answer:
Indexes improve read performance. Types:

Clustered: Alters table structure. Only one per table.

Non-Clustered: Separate from data. Can have multiple.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees(name);
12. What is normalization?
Answer:
Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy. Normal Forms:

1NF: Atomic values

2NF: No partial dependency

3NF: No transitive dependency

13. What are transactions and ACID properties?
Answer:
A transaction is a group of SQL operations. ACID ensures reliability:

Atomicity: All or none

Consistency: Maintains DB state

Isolation: Transactions don't interfere

Durability: Changes persist after commit

14. What is a CTE (Common Table Expression)?
Answer:
A CTE is a temporary result set used within a WITH clause.

sql
Copy
Edit
WITH top_sales AS (
  SELECT * FROM sales WHERE amount > 1000
)
SELECT * FROM top_sales;
15. What are Window Functions?
Answer:
Functions like RANK(), LEAD(), LAG() that operate over a window (partition of rows).

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank FROM employees;
16. How do you optimize a slow SQL query?
Answer:

Use EXPLAIN PLAN or Query Analyzer

Avoid SELECT *

Use proper indexes

Limit joins/subqueries

Use WHERE filtering early

Avoid functions on indexed columns

17. What is the difference between EXISTS and IN?
Answer:

IN: Better for small subquery results.

EXISTS: Better for checking if rows exist — faster with larger datasets.

18. What is a Stored Procedure?
Answer:
A saved SQL block that can be executed with parameters.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployees @DeptId INT AS
BEGIN
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE DeptId = @DeptId;
END
19. What is a Trigger?
Answer:
A trigger is an automatic action that runs in response to events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on a table.

20. What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP?
Type	Purpose	Example
OLTP	Transactional (insert/update)	Banking systems
OLAP	Analytical (reporting)	BI dashboards
