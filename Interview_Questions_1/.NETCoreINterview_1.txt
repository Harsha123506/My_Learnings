Answer:

Feature	.NET Framework	.NET Core
Platform	Windows only	Cross-platform (Win, Linux, macOS)
Open Source	Partially open	Fully open-source
Deployment	System-wide	Can be self-contained
App Types	Desktop, Web	Console, Web, Microservices

3. What is the role of Program.cs and Startup.cs in ASP.NET Core?
Answer:

Program.cs: Entry point of the application. Sets up the web host.

Startup.cs: Configures services and the middleware pipeline.

4. What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?
Answer:
Middleware is software that's assembled into an app pipeline to handle requests and responses. It’s executed in the order added and can:

Modify request/response

Short-circuit pipeline

Call next middleware

5. How is Dependency Injection (DI) handled in .NET Core?
Answer:
.NET Core has built-in DI support. Services are registered in Startup.cs:

csharp
Copy
Edit
services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
Injected via constructor:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public class HomeController
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService;
    public HomeController(IMyService myService)
    {
        _myService = myService;
    }
}
🔁 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Architecture, Configuration, Data Access)
6. What is the difference between AddTransient, AddScoped, and AddSingleton?
Answer:

Lifetime	Description
Transient	New instance every time
Scoped	Same instance per request
Singleton	Same instance for whole app

7. What is Kestrel in ASP.NET Core?
Answer:
Kestrel is the default cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core. It is lightweight, fast, and suitable for both development and production.

8. How does configuration work in .NET Core?
Answer:
.NET Core uses appsettings.json, environment variables, and other providers.

Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "Key": "Value"
  }
}
Read using:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Configuration["AppSettings:Key"]
9. What is EF Core? How is it different from EF6?
Answer:
Entity Framework Core is a lightweight, extensible, open-source ORM for .NET Core. Differences:

EF Core supports LINQ, migrations, and async queries.

EF Core is cross-platform and more flexible than EF6.

EF6 has more mature features like lazy loading (added later in EF Core 2.1+).

Answer:

Use Authentication (JWT, OAuth, Identity).

Use Authorization ([Authorize] attribute).

Use HTTPS.

Validate input data.

13. What is the difference between IHostedService and BackgroundService?
Answer:

IHostedService is the base interface to implement long-running services.

BackgroundService is an abstract class that simplifies implementing IHostedService.

14. What is Middleware Ordering?
Answer:
Order matters. E.g., UseAuthentication must come before UseAuthorization.

csharp

bust, scalable applications from day one.

1> What is the difference between tuples and valueTuples?

tuple :: 
Tuple<int, string> tup1 = new Tuple<int, string>(1,"data1");
var tup2 = Tuple.Create((1,"data2")); //can have negative performance implications.
tup1.Item1 --> to fetch first element from tuple
tup2.Item2 --> to fetch second element from the tuples.
ValueTuple<int,string> tupval = new ValueTuple<int,string>((2,"678"));
var valueTuple = (1,"datyaj"); //its a value type. // valueTuple is mutable. // fields can have names  // mutable // can have more than 8 items.

2> WHat is the difference between "is" and "as"??
is ==> willl check whether if the variable is of specific type 
as ==> will try to cast the value to specific type // will throw null if it couldn't cast // we cant use as to cast value types 

3> what is the use of using statement ?
using directive is used to include namespaces in the program. and also we can create alias for the namespaces. //global using directive is used to include namespaces across the project.
using statement is used to ensure that IDisposable objects are disposed of properly.

4> dynamic keyword in c#?
will check the type at runtime // bypass compile time type checking // can lead to runtime errors if not used carefully.
when we need to use .net compatible language which is type free (iron Python).

"What is the difference between strongly-typed and weakly-typed
 programming languages?"
 the type automatically convert in weakly types without any type casting.

 "What is the difference between statically-typed and dynamically-typed
 programming languages?"
 statically typed --> type checking is done at compile time.

 "What are COM objects?"
 COM stands for “Component Object Model” and it’s a binary-interface standard
 for Windows software components. In simple terms, a COM object is something
 that can be understood by different Windows programs, and for example, it
 can allow communication between Excel and C# programs

5> What are expression Bodied Members ?
A single expresson return method can be write without braces as right side of arrow mark.
we can use them in defining properties 

public Person(string Name) => Name = name;

6> What are Func and Lambda expressions ?
Func  :: allow us to define type of a function.
Func<int, DateTime, string> funcadd; // last type is the return remaining parameters.
Action<string,string, bool> someAction; // for void return types.
Func<int,bool> predicate1 = isLargersthan10;
isAny(numbers, predicate1);
OR
isAny(numbers, isLargerthan10);

Lambda : short form of defining a function with no name
isAny(numbers , x => x%2 == 0);

Delegate :
is a type stores the reference of a method with specific signature.
Delegate void print(string data);
print print1 = x => console.WriteLine(x.toUpper());
print print2 = x => console.WriteLine(x.toLower());
print multicast = print1 + print2;
multicast("Data");

func vs delegate ==> funccan be generic , delegate may r not
delegate can allow out parameters not like func.
delegate can allow defualt values for paramaters.
delegate can have params parameter unlike funcs.

How does the Garbage collector knows which obj can be removed?
works on the mechanism mark and sweep.
1> Reference Counting // negative circular reference.
2> Tracing used in .NET -- checks the reachability of objects for application roots
Application Root ::  Static Fields in Classes and local variables on the thread stack.
text inside if is not stored in stack
3> GC do 1-- identifying objects to no longer needed 2-- Remove those objects 3-- Defragment memory.
Generations of Objects  :: 0 , 1 ,2 ==> rarely checked. 
Large object heaps :: > 85000 B -- they stored in LOP they wont move during defragmentation.
they belongs to generation 2

what is the difference between dispose and finalize ??
dispose :: used to manage unmanaged resources. // Idisposable
finalize :: used when the objects need to cleaned up by Garbage collector.
managed : handled by clr -- objects , variables
unmanaged : not handled by clr -- file handlers , COM Objects, Data Base connections.
GC.Collect() --> is used to call Garbage Collector.
Finalize vs finalizer ==> during run time the destructor turned to Finalize which is called finalizer.

What are the default implementaion in interfaces ?
Indexers ::  are the special members helps to use objects as arrays.
public string this[int index]{
get{
return _dtaa[index];
}
set{
data[index] = value;
}
}

Interface and its members are by default public.

new After .NET 8
can now have method Implementaion.
can have private methods
can have static fields
why?
when we create a interface and publish then we release new version with cancel() we need to force the users to implement the cancel()
instead we can create a icancellable inherited from Iorder(old Interface) and define cancel() which is increasinf many interface declartions in future.
so we can use default implementation.

What is deconstruction in C#?
Allows breaking the object into its individual variables.
(int id, string name)GetPerson() {
    return (1, "data");
}

var (id, name) = GetPerson();
var (_, name) = GetPerson(); // discard id) we can use _ to discard unwanted values.
We can have a deConstruct() method in our class to support deconstruction.)
note :: deconstruct should have same number of out parameters as the number of variables we want to deconstruct.
public void Deconstruct(out int id, out string name) {
    id = this.Id;
    name = this.Name;
}

we can use extension methods to add deconstruct method to existing classes when we dont have access to that class code.
static class DataTimeExtensions {
    public static void Deconstruct(this DateTime dateTime, out int year, out int month, out int day) {
        year = dateTime.Year;
        month = dateTime.Month;
        day = dateTime.Day;
    }
}
(year, month, day) = DateTime.Now;

Why is Catch(Exception) considered a bad practice?
catching general exception cant able to handle specific exceptions.
when to use :
for global exception handling logging purpose.
for cases of not handing exceptions.
for rethrowing exceptions.

throw vs throw ex?
throw :: preserves the original stack trace.
throw ex :: resets the stack trace to current method.

typeOf vs GetType()?
type of :: used to get the type information at compile time. // takes name of the type as parameter.
getType() :: used to get the type information at runtime. // called on instance of the object. // defined in system.Object class.

What is reflection in C#?
Reflection is the ability of a program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. In C#, it is provided by the System.Reflection namespace. It allows you to inspect assemblies, types, methods, properties, and attributes dynamically.
we can able to inspect the type info at runtime.even u dont know abt it at compile time.
we can create a new type at runtime using Reflection.Emit namespace.
cons :: late binding , Lack of JIT Opitmization , security issues.

What are attributes in C#?
Attributes are metadata added to program elements (classes, methods, properties) to provide additional information. They are defined using square brackets [] and can be accessed via reflection at runtime.
How to create a custom attribute?
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Method, Inherited = false)]
public class MyCustomAttribute : Attribute
{
    public string Description { get; }
    public int min { get; }
    public int max { get; }

    public MyCustomAttribute(string description,int min,int max)
    {
        Description = description;
        min = min;
        max = max;
    }
}

[MyCustomAttribute]
Public string data1 {get; set; }}

public class Validator{
    public static void ValidateProperties(object obj) {
        var type = obj.GetType();
        properties  = type.GetProperties().where(property => Attribute.isDefined(property,typeof(customAttribute))); // to pick the properties which has custom attribute.
        foreach (var prop in properties) {
            var attrs = prop.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(MyCustomAttribute), false); // to get all the attributes of specific type.
            if(prop.GetValue(obj).Length < attrs.min and prop.GetValue(obj).Length > attrs.max) {
                throw new Exception($"Property {prop.Name} is out of range.");
            }
        }
    }
}

What is serailization and deserialization?
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, such as JSON or XML. Deserialization is the reverse process of converting the serialized data back into an object.

static string serialize(Person person){
xmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Person));
using (StringWriter writer = new StringWriter()){
    var xmlWriter = XmlWriter.Create(writer,new xmlWriterSettings {Indent = true});
    xmlSerializer.Serialize(xmlWriter, person);
    return writer.ToString();
}}
File.WriteAllText("person.xml", serialize(new Person{Id=1,Name="data"})); // will create a file in root directory.

reading the data back:
static Person deserialize(string xmlData){
    xmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Person));
    using (StringReader reader = new StringReader(xmlData)){
        xmlReader xmlReader = XmlReader.Create(reader);
        return (Person)serializer.Deserialize(xmlReader);
    }
}

[serializable] ==> tells whether the class can serialized with Binary formatter and soap formatter.

What is Pattern Matching in C#?
It is a mechanism to test the expression if it has some characteristics.

public object parservalue(string str, string type){
return type switch
{
"int" => int.parse(str),
"decimal" => decimal.parse(str),
"float" => float.parse(str),
_ => 0 // default condition
}
}

How binary System Works?
the datatypes are stored in memory in binary format.and they have some limitation size.

Checked keyword in c#?
is used to define scope for overflow checking for integral type arithmetic operations and conversions.
checked{
try{
    int a = int.MaxValue;
    int b = a + 1; // will throw overflow exception.
catch(OverflowException ex){
    console.WriteLine("Overflow occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
takes more time to execute due to extra checking.
dont put the catch aound method call instead put inside the method.

double vs decimal?
double is optimized for performance // 64 bits (52 bits for mantissa, 11 bits for exponent, 1 bit for sign)) //15-17 digits of precision
decimal is optimized for precision in financial calculations. // 128 bits (96 bits for mantissa, 16 bits for exponent, 1 bit for sign)) // 28-29 digits of precision
Nan => Not a number (e.g., 0/0))

Jagged array : array having arrays as its elements with different sizes.
u cant resize an array once created.
List.Capacity --> to get or set the capacity of the list().
List.TrimExcess() --> to set the capacity to actual number of elements in the list.
complexity of using insert in list :: we need to move remaining elements to right side to create space for new element.

use of getHashCode() and equals() methods?
getHashCode() :: returns a hash code for the current object. used in hashing algorithms and data structures like a hash table.
hash code works as keys in hashed collections.
hashcode will be generated for reference types based on their memory address.but for value types its based on the value.
so to make two objects equal we need to override getHashCode() method by combining the values hash code of properties.
getHashCode() will use reflection to get all the properties of the object and combine their hash codes to generate a unique hash code for the object.so better to use override method for structs.
for struct the getHashCode() generate based on values by default.
HashCode.Combine(Title, Author, Year); // combines multiple values to generate a single hash code.

Dictionary is th collection of key value pairs where key is unique.

hashTable is the array of Linked Lists where each index represents a bucket.
when we add a key value pair the hashcode of the key is calculated and based on that the index is determined to store the value in that bucket.
we need Equals() method to check whether two keys are equal or not when there is a collision in hashcode (two keys generate same hashcode).
