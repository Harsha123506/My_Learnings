✅ BASIC LEVEL (.NET Core Fundamentals)
1. What is .NET Core?
Answer:
.NET Core is a free, open-source, cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. It supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.

2. Difference between .NET Framework and .NET Core?
Answer:

Feature	.NET Framework	.NET Core
Platform	Windows only	Cross-platform (Win, Linux, macOS)
Open Source	Partially open	Fully open-source
Deployment	System-wide	Can be self-contained
App Types	Desktop, Web	Console, Web, Microservices

3. What is the role of Program.cs and Startup.cs in ASP.NET Core?
Answer:

Program.cs: Entry point of the application. Sets up the web host.

Startup.cs: Configures services and the middleware pipeline.

4. What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?
Answer:
Middleware is software that's assembled into an app pipeline to handle requests and responses. It’s executed in the order added and can:

Modify request/response

Short-circuit pipeline

Call next middleware

5. How is Dependency Injection (DI) handled in .NET Core?
Answer:
.NET Core has built-in DI support. Services are registered in Startup.cs:

csharp
Copy
Edit
services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
Injected via constructor:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public class HomeController
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService;
    public HomeController(IMyService myService)
    {
        _myService = myService;
    }
}
🔁 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Architecture, Configuration, Data Access)
6. What is the difference between AddTransient, AddScoped, and AddSingleton?
Answer:

Lifetime	Description
Transient	New instance every time
Scoped	Same instance per request
Singleton	Same instance for whole app

7. What is Kestrel in ASP.NET Core?
Answer:
Kestrel is the default cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core. It is lightweight, fast, and suitable for both development and production.

8. How does configuration work in .NET Core?
Answer:
.NET Core uses appsettings.json, environment variables, and other providers.

Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "Key": "Value"
  }
}
Read using:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Configuration["AppSettings:Key"]
9. What is EF Core? How is it different from EF6?
Answer:
Entity Framework Core is a lightweight, extensible, open-source ORM for .NET Core. Differences:

EF Core supports LINQ, migrations, and async queries.

EF Core is cross-platform and more flexible than EF6.

EF6 has more mature features like lazy loading (added later in EF Core 2.1+).

10. How do you handle logging in .NET Core?
Answer:
Using built-in logging framework:

csharp
Copy
Edit
ILogger<HomeController> logger;
logger.LogInformation("Info message");
Supports providers like Console, Debug, Azure App Insights, etc.

🔒 ADVANCED LEVEL (Performance, Security, CI/CD, Microservices)
11. Explain the .NET Core request processing pipeline.
Answer:

Request reaches Kestrel

Middleware pipeline is invoked

Routing Middleware determines endpoint

Controller executes

Response is sent back through middleware

12. How do you secure an ASP.NET Core API?
Answer:

Use Authentication (JWT, OAuth, Identity).

Use Authorization ([Authorize] attribute).

Use HTTPS.

Validate input data.

13. What is the difference between IHostedService and BackgroundService?
Answer:

IHostedService is the base interface to implement long-running services.

BackgroundService is an abstract class that simplifies implementing IHostedService.

14. What is Middleware Ordering?
Answer:
Order matters. E.g., UseAuthentication must come before UseAuthorization.

csharp
Copy
Edit
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication(); 
app.UseAuthorization();
15. How do you deploy a .NET Core app in Docker?
Answer:
Use a Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0
COPY ./publish /app
WORKDIR /app
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"]
16. What is a self-contained deployment in .NET Core?
Answer:
An application that includes the .NET runtime. No need to install .NET on the host machine.

17. How is Memory Management handled in .NET Core?
Answer:

Automatic via Garbage Collector

Can force collection: GC.Collect()

Memory profiling tools help with leaks

18. Explain async/await in .NET Core. Why is it important?
Answer:
Used for non-blocking I/O. Improves scalability in web apps.

Example:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public async Task<IActionResult> GetDataAsync()
{
    var data = await _service.GetAsync();
    return Ok(data);
}
19. How do you implement Health Checks in .NET Core?
Answer:
Install:

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks
Configure:

csharp
Copy
Edit
services.AddHealthChecks();
app.UseHealthChecks("/health");
20. Explain gRPC and its benefits in .NET Core.
Answer:

gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework using HTTP/2 and Protobuf.

Used in microservices for efficiency, contract-first development, and bi-directional streaming.

📋 Tips for Interview Preparation
Review .NET 8 if applying in 2025.

Practice unit testing, especially with xUnit, Moq, and TestServer.

Prepare for system design questions involving scalability, caching (e.g., Redis), and security.

Review cloud deployment (Azure, AWS).

Familiarize yourself with CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).

Would you like a PDF version of these questions, or mock interview questions focused on microservices, cloud, or architecture?

Core concepts for .net core from basics to advanced 

ChatGPT said:
Here's a structured breakdown of the core concepts in .NET Core, ranging from basic to advanced, designed to help you master the framework thoroughly — especially useful for development, interviews, and architecture discussions.

🟢 BASICS (Foundation Concepts)
1. .NET Core vs .NET Framework
.NET Core is cross-platform, open-source, and lightweight.

Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Suitable for modern cloud-based or containerized apps.

2. CLR & CLI
CLR (Common Language Runtime): Executes managed code, handles memory, security, and threading.

CLI (Common Language Infrastructure): Defines rules for language interoperability.

3. Project Structure
.csproj file: Now simplified in .NET Core.

Program.cs: App entry point (Main method, configures web host).

Startup.cs: Configures services and HTTP request pipeline.

4. Cross-Platform Development
Write once, run anywhere (Windows, Linux, macOS).

Use .NET CLI to build/run apps:

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet new console
dotnet build
dotnet run
5. Dependency Injection (DI)
Built-in DI container.

Configure in Startup.cs:

csharp
Copy
Edit
services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
🟡 INTERMEDIATE (Web, API, EF Core, Middleware)
6. ASP.NET Core MVC / Web API
Supports MVC, Razor Pages, Blazor, and Web API.

Attribute routing:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[HttpGet("api/products/{id}")]
public IActionResult GetProduct(int id) { ... }
7. Middleware Pipeline
Middleware handles HTTP request/response.

csharp
Copy
Edit
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
8. Entity Framework Core
Lightweight ORM for data access.

Supports:

LINQ queries

Migrations

Fluent API and Data Annotations

csharp
Copy
Edit
var products = await context.Products.ToListAsync();
9. Configuration
Uses appsettings.json, environment variables, and other providers.

Inject IConfiguration to access values.

10. Logging
Built-in support for multiple logging providers (Console, File, Azure).

csharp

Edit
_logger.LogInformation("Message");
🔵 ADVANCED (Security, Performance, Hosting, Microservices)
11. Authentication & Authorization
Supports:

Cookie-based Auth

JWT Bearer Tokens

OAuth/OpenID (via IdentityServer, Azure AD)

12. Hosted Services
For background tasks using IHostedService or BackgroundService.

13. gRPC in .NET Core
For high-performance, cross-language microservice communication.

Uses HTTP/2 and Protobuf.

14. SignalR
Real-time web functionality (chat apps, live dashboards).

15. Health Checks & Monitoring
Use built-in health checks (AddHealthChecks)

Integrate with tools like Prometheus, Grafana.

16. Performance Optimization
Use asynchronous programming with async/await.

Use response caching, output compression.

Minimize GC pressure, manage memory leaks.

17. Unit Testing & Integration Testing
Use xUnit, Moq, and TestServer.

csharp
Copy
Edit
var mockService = new Mock<IMyService>();
18. Containerization with Docker
.NET Core supports self-contained apps.

Dockerfile example:

dockerfile
