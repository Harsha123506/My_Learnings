🔥 JAVASCRIPT (Advanced Level)

Explain event loop in detail.
event loop allows parallel executions in a single threaded environment.
It will check if there are any operations to be executed 
queues callbacks and execute them.

Difference between microtask and macrotask?
when callstack is empty then at priority microtask will be executed (promise.then, async await continuation).then macrotask (settimeout, setimeinterval,IO operations, click events)
Microtask starvation:: if you write promise as a recursive(means a func having promise which resolves the same method). the it will be looping continuosly and microtask queue will be full.

What happens when you run async/await?
if u declare a mthod as a async the return type will become wrapped by promise.
till await synchrnoisation happens then the task will be added as micro task the call will be handled by event loop.

How does hoisting work?
is a behaviour of js to move the declarations to top level while creating.
when js runs it happens 2 phases creation phase , execution phase.
Let and const will be hoisted but sent to TDZ(temporal dead zone) so cant be accessible (throw reference error)

var vs let vs const (internal behavior)
Var store in variable environment, functional scope. 
Let store in Lexiographic env, Block level scope(reference error).no need to initialiaze. placed in TDZ.
const same as let but need to initialise.

Explain closure with real example.
Even the Lexical scope of variable is within the outer function the js remembers the state of the variable even it is completed execution.
Eg: Counter

What is lexical scope?
A function’s scope is determined by where it is written (defined) in the code, not where it is called.

What is prototype & prototype chain?
In JS every Obj is Linked to prototype Which has Methods and properties so the object can inherit.
Prototypechain :: is chain of Objects that js ;looks to find a property or method.
