 BASIC LEVEL (Core Angular Concepts)
1. What is Angular?
Answer:
Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework developed by Google. It's used to build single-page applications (SPAs) with features like two-way binding, dependency injection, routing, and component-based architecture.

2. What are Components in Angular?
Answer:
Components are the basic building blocks of an Angular app. Each component has:

A class (.ts)

A template (.html)

Styles (.css or .scss)

Metadata via @Component decorator

ts
Copy
Edit
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  templateUrl: './example.component.html'
})
export class ExampleComponent { }
3. What is a Module in Angular?
Answer:
A module organizes related components, directives, pipes, and services. The root module is AppModule.

ts
Copy
Edit
@NgModule({
  declarations: [...],
  imports: [...],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
4. What is Two-Way Data Binding?
Answer:
Two-way binding binds data from component to template and vice versa using [(ngModel)].

html
Copy
Edit
<input [(ngModel)]="name">
5. What is Dependency Injection in Angular?
Answer:
Angular's DI system injects services into components, making them loosely coupled and testable.

ts
Copy
Edit
constructor(private userService: UserService) { }
ðŸŸ¡ INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Routing, Services, Forms)
6. What is Routing in Angular?
Answer:
Routing enables navigation between views/components.

ts
Copy
Edit
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: 'home' }
];
Use <router-outlet></router-outlet> in template.

7. Difference between Template-driven and Reactive Forms?
Feature	Template-driven	Reactive
Setup	In HTML	In Component (TypeScript)
Flexibility	Simple, less control	Complex, more control
Validation	Uses directives	Uses form control objects

8. What are Observables in Angular?
Answer:
Observables (from RxJS) are used for async data streams, like HTTP calls and form changes.

ts
Copy
Edit
this.http.get('api/data').subscribe(data => { ... });
9. What is a Service in Angular?
Answer:
Services contain business logic and shared code. They are typically injected via DI.

ts
Copy
Edit
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class DataService { }
10. How to Handle HTTP Calls in Angular?
Answer:
Using HttpClient service.

ts
Copy
Edit
this.http.get<User[]>('/api/users').subscribe(...);
Use HttpInterceptor to handle common logic like headers, error handling.

ðŸ”µ ADVANCED LEVEL (Performance, Architecture, RxJS, Testing)
11. What are Lifecycle Hooks in Angular?
Answer:
Hooks like:

ngOnInit(): Called after data-bound properties are initialized

ngOnChanges()

ngOnDestroy()
Used to hook into component lifecycle events.

12. Explain Change Detection in Angular.
Answer:
Angular detects changes to data-bound properties and updates the DOM. It uses Zone.js to track async events and trigger change detection.

Use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush to optimize performance for immutable data.

13. What are Angular Pipes?
Answer:
Transform displayed values in the template.

html
Copy
Edit
{{ dateValue | date:'shortDate' }}
You can also create custom pipes.

14. What are Directives?
Answer:

Structural: *ngIf, *ngFor (change DOM layout)

Attribute: [ngClass], [ngStyle] (change appearance)

You can create custom directives using @Directive().

15. What is Lazy Loading in Angular?
Answer:
Load feature modules only when needed to improve performance.

ts
Copy
Edit
{ path: 'admin', loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.module').then(m => m.AdminModule) }
16. How to Improve Angular App Performance?
Answer:

Use OnPush change detection

Lazy load modules

Use trackBy in *ngFor

Avoid unnecessary DOM bindings

Use pure pipes and unsubscribing observables

17. What is NgRx?
Answer:
NgRx is a state management library for Angular using Redux principles and RxJS.

Components dispatch actions â†’ Reducers â†’ Store updates â†’ Selectors read state.

18. How to Implement Unit Testing in Angular?
Answer:
Use Karma and Jasmine.

ts
Copy
Edit
describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should render title', () => {
    ...
  });
});
Use TestBed for component testing:

ts
Copy
Edit
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  declarations: [MyComponent],
  providers: [MyService]
});
19. What is Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation?
Answer:
AOT compiles Angular templates at build time (instead of run-time), reducing load time and improving performance.

Use with:

bash
Copy
Edit
ng build --prod
20. Whatâ€™s new in Angular 14â€“17 (if applicable)?
Answer:
Recent features include:

Standalone components

Typed reactive forms

Signals (in preview)

Enhanced SSR & hydration

Enhanced CLI and developer ergonomics

throttling :: 
1> if user is typing in search box and we are calling api for every key press it will make lot of api calls. to avoid that we can use throttling.
2> it will wait for some time after the last key press and then it will make the api call.
3> we can use rxjs operators like debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged etc.,
this.searchControl.valueChanges.pipe(
  debounceTime(300), // wait for 300ms after the last event
  distinctUntilChanged() // only emit if value is different from previous value
).subscribe(value => {
  this.search(value);
});
OR
throttle(function, limit) {
  let inThrottle;
  return function() {
    const args = arguments;
    const context = this;
    if (!inThrottle) {
      function.apply(context, args);
      inThrottle = true;
      setTimeout(() => inThrottle = false, limit);
    }
  }
})

21. What is Angular Universal?
Answer:
Angular Universal enables server-side rendering (SSR) of Angular applications, improving performance and SEO. It pre-renders the app on the server and sends HTML to the client.

22. How to Secure an Angular Application?
Answer:
Use Angular's built-in security features like DomSanitizer to prevent XSS attacks.
Implement authentication and authorization using JWT or OAuth.
Use route guards (CanActivate, CanLoad) to protect routes.

23. closure in javascript?
Answer:
A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. This allows the function to remember the environment in which it was created.
function outerFunction() {
  let count = 0;
  return function innerFunction() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
}
const counter1 = makeCounter();
console.log(counter1()); // 1
console.log(counter1()); // 2

const counter2 = makeCounter();
console.log(counter2()); // 1 (different `count`)

24. What are Signals in Angular?
Answer:
Signals are a new reactive primitive introduced in Angular 16 that allow you to create reactive state and automatically update the UI when the state changes. Signals can be used to manage state in a more fine-grained way compared to traditional change detection.
