⭐ What Interviewers Expect at 6+ Years

You should be able to:

Design systems, not just explain services

Justify trade-offs

Talk about real incidents

Show cost + security awareness

If you want, I can:

Conduct a mock Azure interview

Provide answers with architecture diagrams

Focus on Azure for .NET developers

Share real-world Azure design case studies
