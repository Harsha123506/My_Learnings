Azure Fundamentals (Must Be Strong)

Difference between Azure IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
Iaas : Provides VM, DataBase, Networking 
User :: Os , Application and datA, runtime.
eg :: Virtul machine , virtul Load balancer , Virtul Nework.

Paas : Provides infrastructure , OS , runtime, Middleware
User :: Application.
eg  :: Azure app services , Azure functions , Azure sql database.

SAAS : provides platform , Application
User :: settings , Data Usge
eg :: Microsoft 365, O365, Power Bi.

Note :: U wont get the chnce to pick lthe specific services. U can pick as mixed 

Azure Regions vs Availability Zones
Azure Regions :: are the Physical regions consists multiple data centers within it , independennt to each other.
Availability Zones :: they are the physical data centers which maintins it own database , networking and cooling used for failover within same region.


Azure Resource Groups – purpose and lifecycle
Its container mnges all resources based on appliction , environment nd project
contins Vms , Load Balancers , networks , app services.
pros :: access on group level , policies , create , delete resources.
Note :: 
1> Exists in One Location. 
2> Resource Groups do not nest.
3> RG location ≠ resource location.  // RG loctions is the place where meta data is stored.

Azure ARM templates vs Bicep vs Terraform
These are the coding types to create resources in Azure
ARM :: Json Format , High Boiler Plate , Hard to red and write., No external tool required
Bicep :: Microsoft introduced, Converts into ARM Json, Azure specific no multi cloud support
Terrform  :: Multi CLoyd Support.

Azure Subscription vs Management Group
subscription :: is a resource level Billing, one subscription per resource
Management Group :: is a set of Subscriptions used to scle subscriptions,Governnce rules.

Azure Azure Portal vs Azure CLI vs PowerShell

🔹 Compute Services

Azure VM vs App Service vs Azure Functions
Vm (IAAS):: User manages OS , Runtime , APpliction , Flexible for OS level Operations, Used for old platform specific apps.
App Services(PAAS) :: User manges code, Quick Deployment using CICD Pipelines.
Azure Functions (FAAS) :: scales to zero when not needed. Server Less , EVent Driven, Extremely cost Efficient.

When to use Container Apps vs AKS
continer Apps :: just deploy app , all are managed automatically by container.
AKS ::  we need mange clusters , Nodes, Networking and scaling policies.

App Service scaling (vertical vs horizontal)
Vertical Scaling :: u ADD resources of single app service INstance , RAM , SSD (s1 plan to s2) (our app is CPU or memory-bound on its current instance.)
Horizontal scaling :: U Add app services instances. (Your app needs to handle more concurrent requests.)

Azure Functions Consumption vs Premium vs Dedicated plans
Consumption -- coldstart, pay as u go 
Premium  -- there is a warning instnces, Offers ENhnced Performance.
Dedicated -- will run the app  functions within Azure vm, USED FOR  fixed traffic.

Cold start problem – how do you handle it?
When a request came to functions it has to provise Vm r container to run the serverless code , runtime has to be initialised, Load dependencies and run.
use premium plan , use periodic requests.

VM Scale Sets use cases
re set of ideal vms tht scales automticlly based on demand 

Blue-green & Canary deployments in Azure
Blue --> Current Production
green --> new version
using load balancer we will shift the traffic to new version server after testing.

🔹 Networking (Very Important at 6 Years)

VNet, Subnet, NSG, ASG differences
VNEt  :: Fundamanetal network boundary in Azure, allow to communicate between resources.
Subnet :: range of ip addresses within V NET, Azure resources are deployed inside subnet.
NSG  :: Fire wall for Subnets /nic
ASG :: A Logical groups for vms to manage NSGs.

Azure Load Balancer vs Application Gateway
Azure Load Balancer :: layer 4 load balancer apply on TCP/UDP Level, session affinity hash based.
Application Gate Way :: Layer 7 Load Balancer apply on http/https level, session affinity is coockie based. navigates the routing of the request with different backend pools.

first application gateway will decide based on route urls which tier need to go (web , app , database)
then in specific tier , load balancer based on port it will select specific instance.

Azure Front Door vs Traffic Manager
Azure Front Door :: will acts as a proxy at the application level. manages security, Cache Content, Url rewriting..
Traffic Manager :: will acts as a DNS manager.at the DNS Level.

Private Endpoint vs Service Endpoint
Private Endpoint :: provide ip to access between services and azure resources within vnet (private link communication)
service endpoint :: provides ip to access in public. (via azure backbone)

How does DNS work in Azure?
in vnet we have default dns resolver 
and we have private and public dns service.

Justify trade-offs

Talk about real incidents

Show cost + security awareness

If you want, I can:

Conduct a mock Azure interview

Focus on Azure for .NET developers

Share real-world Azure design case studies

Tailor questions for Azure Architect / Senior Dev roles
