Core Angular & Architecture

How does Angular’s change detection work internally?
Zone.js ,omitors events , bndings , promises , Observables.
if any change found triggers the change detection from the app roots.reevaluates bindings , Update dom
Note :: It does not diff objects deeply — it checks references, not structure.

What is the difference between Default and OnPush change detection strategies?
will trigger change detection of every Life cycle by zone.js while need to call cd.detectChanges();

Explain Angular compilation: JIT vs AOT.
JIT :: app sends compiler and templetes then browser will compile to js and run app (Faster rebuild,Hot Reload,Better error Messages)(Large Files, slow start up)
AOT :: app compile templates and send pure js, browser run js (fast app start up , high security, Errors caught at build time)(long Build Time)

What are standalone components? How do they differ from NgModules?
standalone :: they rely on its own dependencies, Lazy Loading 
ngModules :: components rely on modules, Large, tightly coupled modules

How does Angular handle dependency injection hierarchy?
provided-in : root,
@Module
@Component

What are providers, useClass, useValue, useFactory, and useExisting?
providers: [
  { provide: 'API_CONFIG', useValue: config }
]
@inject("API_CONFIG")
providers: [
  { provide: LoggerService, useFactory: loggerFactory, deps: [EnvironmentService] }
]
providers: [
  MyService,
  { provide: AnotherService, useExisting: MyService }
]

How do you design a scalable Angular application architecture?
core, shared, feuture
Lazy Loading 
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'products', loadChildren: () => import('./features/products/products.module').then(m => m.ProductsModule) }
];
Smart vs Dumb components: seeparation of concerns
Performance Optimization lazyLoading,trackBy , No Method in html , change detection

What problems does Angular solve compared to plain JavaScript or jQuery?
dependency injection, component architecture, 2 way data Binding, Routing

What are Angular signals? How do they compare with RxJS?
component level reactive state , http interactions - streams -- complex async cross component logic.

How does zone.js work and why is it used?
it allows angular when the async tasks completes and trigger change detection.
setTimeout(callback, delay, ...args) ==runs after some delay
setInterval(callback, interval, ...args) ==> run after certain interval repeatedly

2. Components, Directives & Pipes

Directives -- Changes the Behaviour of DOM
component, structural, Behavioural
@HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() {

Lifecycle hooks execution order and real-world use cases
ngonchanges,ngoninit ,ngdocheck,ngaftercontentinit,ngaftercontentchecked,ngafterviewinit,nfafterviewchecked, ngondestroy

Difference be. Get the data of tween @ViewChild, @ContentChild, and @ViewChildren
@ViewChild == Get the element , component , directive from its own View
@ViewChildren == Get Multiple element from its own View.
@ContentChild == Get element Projected Via ng content

When would you use a structural directive vs a component?
when u want only structure change not logic implement, no stylings

How do pure and impure pipes differ?
 pure: false
 executes only when reference of input changes

How to optimize heavy pipes?
use pure pipes
use async pipes for loop operations
cache pipe returned data
use on push change detection
avoid using pipes instead of for.'
use track by 

What happens when an @Input() value changes?
parent changes the value 
change detection 
@input bindings search 
reassigns the value to @input

How does Angular handle content projection (ng-content)?

3. RxJS & Reactive Programming (Very Important)

Difference between Subject, BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject, and AsyncSubject
doesnt hold previous data,emit previous data immediately,emit buffer data when subscribed,emits only when completes.

switchMap vs mergeMap vs concatMap vs exhaustMap
cancel precious observable , return all as one, queue the Observables, ignore existing if previous is active.

How do you avoid nested subscriptions?
Use SwitchMap, Merge Map , concat map , foRK jOIN
we can use scan, pair wise,with layest from to use previous state

What is cold vs hot observable?
cold: data is produced when u subscribe , 
hot: data is produced u will get when u subscribe.

How do you handle memory leaks in Angular?
unsubscribe the Observable
takeuntilldestroyed
clear time intervals 
destroy third party libraries

Explain takeUntil and real-world usage
source$.pipe(
  takeUntil(stop$)
)
subscribe , Kill if the stop$ value changes
multiple will be killed at once

How does the async pipe work internally?
1> SUbscribes when the view is rendered
2> takes the latest value of the data.
3> Marks for check
4>

Error handling strategies in RxJS

How would you retry an API call conditionally?

Difference between debounceTime and throttleTime

4. Forms (Template & Reactive)

Template-driven vs Reactive forms – which do you prefer and why?

How do custom validators work?
//to create a class inherit from validatorFN and then add the name of the class 
 return (control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null => {
    const forbidden = control.value === forbiddenName;
    return f

Async validators – real-world use case

How do you dynamically add/remove form controls?

Difference between setValue and patchValue

How do you handle cross-field validation?

5. Routing & Navigation

Lazy loading vs Preloading strategies

How does Angular Route Guards work internally?

Difference between CanActivate, CanActivateChild, CanLoad, and Resolve

How do you handle role-based routing?

How to pass data between routes?

How does router state snapshot differ from observable state?

6. Performance Optimization

How do you optimize Angular application performance?

TrackBy function – when and why?

Lazy loading modules vs components

How do you detect performance bottlenecks?

How does server-side rendering (SSR) help performance?

What is Angular Universal?

How do you reduce bundle size?
Ahead of time , tree shaking 

How does tree shaking work?
checks the apps referenced used if not found removed.

7. State Management
