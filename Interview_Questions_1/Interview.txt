1> cross platform 
2> Open source
3> Integration of UI 
4> Hosting -- Kestrel , IIS , nginx.

6> Supports Multiple IDE

.Net Request LifeCycle:

call the request from the client 
host server creation 
server fetches the request and pass it to middleware pipeline 
then routing will happen 
model binding 
Action Execution 
result execution
response middleware throw the result to client.

Kestrel Working 

Sockets Listening : Kestrel opens TCP sockets on configured ports (e.g., 5000, 443).
Connections Management : Each Connection is established and handled independently
Request Parsing : Raw Bytes which are request header , request line and body are parsed.
httpContext Creation : http response and http request Object creation takes place.
middleware execution 
controller end point execution
Connection Reuse

How does Side-by-Side versioning work in .NET Core?
each app will run individually with different runtimes as mentioned in app.runtimeconfig.json
app runs on its own process.

What is self-contained vs framework-dependent deployment?
self-contained : app will be deployed with its runtime. unlike FDD
