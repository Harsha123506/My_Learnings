Learnings ::
Iaas, Paas, Saas
Iaas - Infrastructure as a Service:
Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users manage OS, applications, and data while the provider manages the underlying infrastructure.
Examples: Azure Virtual Machines, Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine.
PaaS - Platform as a Service:
Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure
Examples: Azure App Service, Google App Engine, Heroku.
SaaS - Software as a Service:
Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. The provider manages everything, and
users access the software via a web browser.
Examples: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce.

public cloud - Services are delivered over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations. Examples: Azure, AWS, Google Cloud.
private cloud - Cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by
a third party. Examples: VMware vSphere, OpenStack.
hybrid cloud - Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between
them. Examples: Azure Stack, AWS Outposts.

Azure Portal & Subscription
Azure Portal - A web-based interface for managing Azure resources and services.
Azure Subscription - A logical container for Azure resources, tied to a billing account.(Pay-As-You-Go, Free Trial, or Enterprise Agreement.)
>> Multiple VMs in different RGs can connect to the same VNet using peering.
>> Blobs or queues can be accessed via connection strings by apps in any RG.
>> Secrets and keys can be accessed by apps in multiple RGs using RBAC or access policies.
Azure Resource Groups - A container that holds related Azure resources for an application or service.
Azure Pricing & Cost Management - Tools and services to monitor, allocate, and optimize cloud spending.
Azure Resources & Services - Various services offered by Azure, including compute, storage, networking, and databases.
Virtual Machines (VMs) - On-demand, scalable computing resources that can run various operating systems
Storage Accounts - A secure account to store data objects like blobs, files, queues, and tables
App Services - A platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs
Azure SQL Database - A managed relational database service based on SQL Server
Networking Basics - Fundamental concepts of networking in Azure, including IP addressing, DNS, and routing
Virtual Networks (VNet) - A logically isolated network in Azure for securely connecting Azure resources
Network Security Groups (NSG) - A set of rules to control inbound and outbound traffic to.
Public/Private IPs - IP addresses assigned to Azure resources for communication over the internet or within a VNet

Azure Compute & Hosting
App Services - A fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs
webApps : A service for hosting web applications, RESTful APIs, and mobile backends
