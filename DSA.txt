Abstract Data Type :: Hiding Details of a data structure 
It provides a method to access and modify the data structure without exposing its implementation details.
Example: Stack, Queue, List, Tree, Graph

Timecomplexity :: measure max time taken by code to complete the logic;
spacecomplexity  :: measure max space needed for the code ;

O notation -- Worst Case  f(n) <= cg(n);
Omega Notation -- best case 
theta notation -- average notation
