Abstract Data Type :: Hiding Details of a data structure 
It provides a method to access and modify the data structure without exposing its implementation details.
Example: Stack, Queue, List, Tree, Graph

Timecomplexity :: measure max time taken by code to complete the logic;
spacecomplexity  :: measure max space needed for the code ;

O notation -- Worst Case  f(n) <= cg(n);
Omega Notation -- best case 
theta notation -- average notation 

time complexity of recursive functions  :: 

T[n] + n  n > 1
1         n = 1 

then 

T[n-k] + n-k-1 + n-k-2 ---- n-1 + n
n-k = 1
n = k+1 
T[1] + 0 + 1 + 2 ---- n
n(n+1)/2 -- O(n^2)

Tail and Head -- calling the recursive method in the bottom is tail and head is its opposite 

Tree Recursion -- Combining Both tail and head recursion.

Indirect recursion -- One method is caling other and other method is calling 1st method
methodA(n){                   
methodB(n-1);
}

methodB(n){                   
methodA(n-1);
}

Algorithms ::
Linear Search --> searching untill got the data.

Binary Search --> works only if the array i in sorted array 
check the middle number if matches return else check if it is grether r less than needed number 

sorting algorithm --> selection , insertion , bubble , merge , quick , heap , shell , count ,bucket , radix 

stable and unstable sorting --> if u have duplicate data the order of duplicates shouldn't be changed.

eg ::  4,3,5(0),5(1),1,2,6  

stable 1,2,3,4,5(0),5(1),6
unstable 1,2,3,4,5(1),5(0),6

selection Sort :: pick min value from array and place it in appropriate position. (unstable and O(n^2))

insertion sort :: divide array into sorted(first element intitally) and remaining and add each element from remaining to sorted and do the sorting (O(n ^ 2) stable)

Bubblesort :: compare 2 numbers from the array and its continue till all the data is sorted.
